**Understanding the Stock Data**

Let us understand various columns for further analysis.

The Open and Close columns indicate the opening and closing price of the stocks on a particular day.
The High and Low columns provide the highest and the lowest price for the stock on a particular day, respectively.

The Volume column tells us the total volume of stocks traded on a particular day.

The volume weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of a security.source.

**Visualization**

We visualize the VWAP of INFOSYS shares and plot VWAP to visualize how the prices and value fluctuate over time.This is a very basic plot, to make it more meaningful let us plot month and year wise trends.
